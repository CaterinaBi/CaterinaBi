# What I've been up to lately 🙃

🤖 As a part of my training in ML, I have been developing a [Recommendation Ranking System](https://github.com/CaterinaBi/aicore-recommendation-ranking-system) along the lines of that of Facebook Marketplace.

🚀 My colleagues Giuseppe Samo, Fuzhen Si and I have been playing with the 🤗 Transformers to understand bias in Healthcare Communication ([one paper](https://github.com/CaterinaBi/health-communication-paper2/blob/main/paper2022/Health-Related%20Content%20(Samo%2C%20Fuzhen).pdf) has been published, [one submitted](https://github.com/CaterinaBi/health-communication-paper2/blob/main/paper2023/first-submission/BonanSamo2023.pdf), and one is on its way).

👀 I have recently collaborated on the [Deploying a Classifier to Stop Online Violence Against Children using NLP](https://omdena.com/projects/stop-online-violence-against-children/) and [Conversational AI Chatbot for People Affected by Inflation](https://omdena.com/projects/conversational-ai-chat-bot-for-people-affected-by-inflation/) Omdena Local Chapters, and I'm now leading several tasks (data collection, EDA, data pre-processing) of the [Building a Chatbot for Tourists in the UAE using NLP](https://omdena.com/projects/building-a-chatbot-for-tourists-in-the-uae/) and [Detecting Hateful and Offensive Language using NLP](https://omdena.com/projects/detecting-hateful-and-offensive-language-using-nlp/) Chapters 🔥

🤯 I'm part of the Romance team at [Polyglot](https://github.com/CaterinaBi/polyglot), an Open-Souce project by [EleutherAI](https://github.com/EleutherAI) for the creation of large multi-lingual language models of well-balanced competence.

🤓 I am working on the beta version of [pypelet](https://github.com/CaterinaBi/pypelette), a community project that utilises NLP to create an open source corpus of spoken interactions in the Romance languages 🔥 (join us! ♥)
