# Hi, I’m @CaterinaBi!

## I'm a **formal linguist** by education, and I've been training to become a **NLP engineer** 🤖

👩‍🎓 I've been a postdoctoral researcher at the **University of Cambridge**, UK, since 2019.

👀 I’m interested in comparative syntax, language documentation, Deep NLP and more generally ML.

🌱 I’m currently learning to code in **Python** for AI.

💞️ I’m *always* looking to collaborate on small projects related to the field of linguistics.
